               <p> A job portal is a website where people who need jobs can find jobs and companies 
                looking for job seekers can find the perfect employees. It serves as a medium where 
                job seekers can create profiles, upload resumes, and search for job openings across 
                various industries and locations. Employers, on the other hand, can post job vacancies, 
                review applicant profiles, and conduct the initial stages of the hiring process through 
                the portal. </p>
